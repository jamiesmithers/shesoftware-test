### SHE Software - Test

To execute the test, clone the repo. Once done, navigate to the root folder and execute `npm install` in the terminal.

When the packages have been installed, update the `url`, `username` and `password` fields in `global --> lib --> login.js`.

Once the above is complete, in the terminal enter `npm test`.
